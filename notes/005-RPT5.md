# RPT5

Let's start by building a list of files based on enqueues.

If the enqueue's `data.nesting` is 0 and it has no `data.file`, then `data.name` is the file name. Otherwise, it's a test or suite within a file.

Add a function to build a summary output showing files that were run.

For enqueues that don't meet file criteria, add as a test.

In the summary function, sort tests by file and line number and print with indenting based on nesting.

NEXT:

- when a test is a child of another test, flag the parent started.
- when a test in a file is started, flag the file started.
- when a test passes, flag it passed and set run time.
