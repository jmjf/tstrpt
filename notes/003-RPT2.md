# RPT2

I note that Node's reporter gives a stack dump for failed tests that includes useful (and correct for TypeScript) error location data in the first line of the stack dump.

```
âœ– TEST-FAIL (2.058766ms)
    Error: expect(received).toBeLessThan(expected)
    
    Expected: < 4
    Received:   5

      matcherResult: { message: '\x1B[2mexpect(\x1B[22m\x1B[31mreceived\x1B[39m\x1B[2m).\x1B[22mtoBeLessThan\x1B[2m(\x1B[22m\x1B[32mexpected\x1B[39m\x1B[2m)\x1B[22m\n\nExpected: < \x1B[32m4\x1B[39m\nReceived:   \x1B[31m5\x1B[39m', pass: false }
    }
```

I'd like to pare that down and maybe even get real location data.

RPT1 doesn't show the stack dump. Where is Node getting it from?

RPT2 expands RPT1 to do an `Object.entries` traversal of the `event.data.error` member for failure events. Node docs say `event.data.error` is an `Error` that includes another `Error`. From past experience, I know `Error` may carry data that isn't easily viewable.

First run returns for the failing test

```
TEST:FAIL
{
   "type": "test:fail",
   "data": {
      "name": "TEST-FAIL",
      "nesting": 1,
      "testNumber": 2,
      "details": {
         "duration_ms": 3.521663,
         "error": {
            "failureType": "testCodeFailure",
            "cause": {
               "matcherResult": {
                  "message": "\u001b[2mexpect(\u001b[22m\u001b[31mreceived\u001b[39m\u001b[2m).\u001b[22mtoBeLessThan\u001b[2m(\u001b[22m\u001b[32mexpected\u001b[39m\u001b[2m)\u001b[22m\n\nExpected: < \u001b[32m4\u001b[39m\nReceived:   \u001b[31m5\u001b[39m",
                  "pass": false
               }
            },
            "code": "ERR_TEST_FAILURE"
         }
      },
      "line": 8,
      "column": 5,
      "file": "file:///workspace/test/test.spec.ts"
   }
}

error.failureType: string = testCodeFailure
error.cause: object = Error: expect(received).toBeLessThan(expected)

Expected: < 4
Received:   5
error.code: string = ERR_TEST_FAILURE
error.cause.matcherResult: object = [object Object]
```

So, I wonder if `matcherResult` has anything else useful. I'll add code to traverse it.

```
TEST:FAIL
{
   "type": "test:fail",
   "data": {
      "name": "TEST-FAIL",
      "nesting": 1,
      "testNumber": 2,
      "details": {
         "duration_ms": 4.454227,
         "error": {
            "failureType": "testCodeFailure",
            "cause": {
               "matcherResult": {
                  "message": "\u001b[2mexpect(\u001b[22m\u001b[31mreceived\u001b[39m\u001b[2m).\u001b[22mtoBeLessThan\u001b[2m(\u001b[22m\u001b[32mexpected\u001b[39m\u001b[2m)\u001b[22m\n\nExpected: < \u001b[32m4\u001b[39m\nReceived:   \u001b[31m5\u001b[39m",
                  "pass": false
               }
            },
            "code": "ERR_TEST_FAILURE"
         }
      },
      "line": 8,
      "column": 5,
      "file": "file:///workspace/test/test.spec.ts"
   }
}

error.failureType: string = testCodeFailure
error.cause: object = Error: expect(received).toBeLessThan(expected)

Expected: < 4
Received:   5
error.code: string = ERR_TEST_FAILURE
error.cause.matcherResult: object = [object Object]
error.cause.matcherResult.message: string = expect(received).toBeLessThan(expected)

Expected: < 4
Received:   5
error.cause.matcherResult.pass: boolean = false
```

Based on this, it looks like there is no stack data here. I wonder if the Node reporter is doing something behind the scenes to get that stack dump. Or if it knows something about the error structure that I don't.

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/stack) suggests there's a `stack` member. Let's pretend it might exist and isn't showing for some reason.

```

   "type": "test:fail",
   "data": {
      "name": "TEST-FAIL",
      "nesting": 1,
      "testNumber": 2,
      "details": {
         "duration_ms": 1.863084,
         "error": {
            "failureType": "testCodeFailure",
            "cause": {
               "matcherResult": {
                  "message": "\u001b[2mexpect(\u001b[22m\u001b[31mreceived\u001b[39m\u001b[2m).\u001b[22mtoBeLessThan\u001b[2m(\u001b[22m\u001b[32mexpected\u001b[39m\u001b[2m)\u001b[22m\n\nExpected: < \u001b[32m4\u001b[39m\nReceived:   \u001b[31m5\u001b[39m",
                  "pass": false
               }
            },
            "code": "ERR_TEST_FAILURE"
         }
      },
      "line": 8,
      "column": 5,
      "file": "file:///workspace/test/test.spec.ts"
   }
}

error.cause: object = Error: expect(received).toBeLessThan(expected)

```

Now we have something to think about--how to get the real stack from the `cause.stack` member so we can grab the first line.
