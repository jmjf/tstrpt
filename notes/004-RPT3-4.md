# RPT3 and RPT4

Based on RPT2, it looks like I could take the `cause.stack`, slice of "Error: " plus the `matcherResult.message` and get just the stack dump.

`rpt3.mjs` is the detailed breakdown.

`rpt4.mjs` is a first pass short version. I want to:

- Improve some of the string handling (less repetition)
- Add more and more complex test structures to ensure indents, etc., are right
- Add color coding to keywords
- Improve parsing of the error cause line
